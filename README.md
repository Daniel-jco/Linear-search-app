# Linear Search
I chose linear search because gradio and GUIs in general are very new to me. I figured choosing a simple, easy to impliment searching algorithm would be beneficial in allowing me to focus on the harder parts of this project like learning gradio and implimenting the algorithm with visuals. I also think linear search is an important algorithm in education because many people are used to the idea of iterating through a list looking for a specific element before they are even introduced to searching algorithms. Linear search comes up everywhere, and you might not even realize that you're using a searching algorithm when you use it.
